# Collaborative Filtering Based Book Recommendation System

## Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendation System
Recommender systems provide personalized information by learning the user’s interests through traces of 
interaction with that user. Much like machine learning algorithms, 
a recommender system makes a prediction based on a user’s past behaviors. 
Specifically, it’s designed to predict user preference for a set of items based on experience.<br>

Collaborative Filtering recommends items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. 
The basic assumption behind the algorithm is that users with similar interests have common preferences.

## Tools Used
•	Jupyter notebook  - pandas, numpy and sklearn library<br>
•	Pycharm - Flask

## Project Overview
The collaborative filtering algorithm and book popularity are the foundation of this book recommendation system project.
Only active users with rating counts bigger than 200 and books with rating counts greater than 50 were considered during the preprocessing stage.<br>
The Top 50 books according to popularity will be displayed on the home page.<br>
The user-inputted book name will display ten related books on the recommendation page.<br>
